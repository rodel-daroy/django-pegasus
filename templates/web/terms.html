                                partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Mailerrize as a
                                result of this agreement or use of the Site. Mailerrize&apos;s performance of this
                                agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this
                                agreement is in derogation of Mailerrize&apos;s right to comply with governmental, court
                                and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or
                                information provided to or gathered by Mailerrize with respect to such use. If any part
                                of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable
                                law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations
                                set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded
                                by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
                                provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
